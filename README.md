# Caesar Cipher Tool
The Caesar Cipher Tool is a Python program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It also provides an analysis of the input message, including the count of alphabetic characters, digits, and special characters.
## Features
- **Encryption and Decryption:** Users can choose to either encrypt or decrypt a message.
- **Shift Value:** The tool accepts a shift value to determine the encryption or decryption pattern.
- **Message Analysis:** Provides information about the input message, such as the first and last characters, total characters, alphabetic characters, digits, and special characters.
## Usage
1. Run the `caesar_cipher_tool.py` script using Python.
2. Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message by entering 'E' for encryption, 'D' for decryption, or 'Q' to quit.
3. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
4. If encrypting, provide a shift value to determine the encryption pattern.
5. The program will output the encrypted or decrypted message along with an analysis of the input message.
